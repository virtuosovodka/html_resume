    <h2>About Me:</h2>
    <p>I am a senior at Ida B. Wells High School. I plan to double major in Computer Science with Finance and a minor in Mathematics at Oregon State University. I love to pursue new hobbies, seek out various opportunities, and understand my environment and the people within it. I have experience as a community organizer at a local shelter and an aide at my martial arts studio. I strive to challenge myself, pushing past my potential in my education and extracurriculars, by self-studying, taking challenging courses, and excelling in my hobbies. As a second-generation immigrant, I learn about and understand my culture while integrating into my communities.</p>
